\arguments{
\item{height}{Number of tiles for height}

\item{width}{Number of tiles for width}

\item{ncluster}{Number of cluster in simulation}

\item{max.norm}{A numeric value. All points with norm â‰¤ max.norm are included.}

\item{param.mat}{Parameter matrix for simulating spatial relationships between clusters; should be ncluster-by-ncluster}

\item{ncycle}{Cycles to run in MRF simulation}

\item{plot}{A logical value, whether draw the plot}

\item{random.seed}{Random seed to use}
}
\value{
A matrix with the sampled field.

\description{
With given tuned parameters, this function performs a simulation of ST data that includes spatial
relationships between clusters. It could be used as the simulation data for any ST-related algorithms.
