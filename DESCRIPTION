Description: The package is designed to capture the latent abstract structure from spatial data (mostly spatial transcriptomics data) by creating a spatial abstract map (SAM). It can simplify the complicated spatial structure provided with spatial annotations on your data. Spatial distances between different annotation labels are calculated and used to reflect the abstract structure.
